## What is this?

### Nov 6, 2021

I am currently a student in an app development course at Kennesaw State University.  I'm taking the course as part of my economics degree, and this project is one of the requirements for the course.

I'm attempting to make a markdown editor that syncs to Dropbox and can export to html.  I really wanted to use something other than Tkinter, but I don't think I have time to accomplish it this semester.  I'd like to continue improving the program after the class ends.
